## What is this project
This project is a sample of distributed architecture with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/)
It is constituted of 3 containerized apps:
- A Blazor Frontend
- An AspNetCore Backend
- An AspNetCore minimal api used as test entry point

Other containers:
- 3 dapr SideCar (one by app) they will contains informations about dapr components and global configuration.
- A kafka broker (co) it is consumed by the Backend and for now is feed by the minimal api.
- A Kafdrop services, it is connected to the kafka broker and expose a WebUi to monitor and manage the topics. [Kafdrop documentation](https://github.com/obsidiandynamics/kafdrop)
- A Zipkin service, it will monitor everything transiting through the sidecars. [Zipkin documentation](https://zipkin.io/)
